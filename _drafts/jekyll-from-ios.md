Most of the editing I do on this blog is/will be done on my laptop, and mostly in Vim.

But that is not really great, if I want to post something while I am away from my laptop.

So I need to figure something out.

## Prose.io

http://prose.io/ seems good. I think it is designed specifically for Jekyll sites. I have been writing this post in that site so far, and it works okay, but not great.

Most annoying is that it does not take advantage of iOS's autocorrect[^1], e.g. spelling, uppercaseing first letters, double-tap space for full stop.

Plus it's a web app, so I need Internet access to use it.

So while this does kinda work, it's not great, and I can see myself getting frustrated with it quite easily.

So. Let's find other options.

## TODO

https://workingcopyapp.com maybe
Because Git

[^1]: That alone is interesting to me. I want to see how this app works, because it is obviously doing something odd.
