Most of the editing I do on this blog is/will be done on my laptop, and mostly in Vim.

But that is not really great, if I want to post something while I am away from my laptop.

So I need to figure something out.

## Prose.io

http://prose.io/ seems good. I think it is designed specifically for Jekyll sites. I have been writing this post in that site so far, and it works okay, but not great.

Most annoying is that it does not take advantage of iOS's autocorrect[^1], e.g. spelling, uppercaseing first letters, double-tap space for full stop.

Plus it's a web app, so I need Internet access to use it.

But it does integrate directly with GitHub, so I save posts and drafts easily.

So while this does kinda work, it's not great, and I can see myself getting frustrated with it quite easily.

So. Let's find other options.

## Octopage

https://appsto.re/gb/rk9UM.i

This app actually works quite well. It has offline editing, preview, and a Markdown syntax guide.

There are a few bugs though, the most annoying of which is that it occasionally scrolls up when I preview the post then go back to edit mode.

It also only has drafts local to the app. No way (yet) of using the drafts directory in the repo.
I've asked the dev to add that functionality, so we'll see what happens.

That's not a deal breaker, but it does mean that any post I don't complete in this app can't be picked up on my laptop.

Which means that, while I can write my thoughts on the app using the app itself, I need to update my page draft with a different app.

## TODO

Because Git

[^1]: That alone is interesting to me. I want to see how this app works, because it is obviously doing something odd.
