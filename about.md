Hi, my name is Tino Margely and I am a 19 years old french engineering student. I am writing this blog to share my passion of Data Science with anyone interested in that subject. I fell in love with data science a few years ago, after a discussion I had with an amazing statistical researcher / teacher from ENSAI (National School of Statistics and Data Analysis). I have always been very interested in statistics and data anlaysis but I did never thought of it as a profession until this encounter. I used to create a lot of Excel spreadsheets for anything : Track my  expenses and incomes, Have a look on my handball games statistics, ... I really enjoy that feeling of being like a detective of the dataset, trying to extract some informations to undestand what is hapenning behind those numbers. Apart from that, I also am very interested in sport, especially Basketball tat I practice two to three times a week and in competitions, and I have a lot of different passions. I'm very interested in Photography where I constantly try to imporove myself, in beer tasting, rollerblading, ...
