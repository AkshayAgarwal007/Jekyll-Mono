title: A Numpy Approach of the Monty Hall Problem
author: Tino Margely
---
This was my very first Data Science Project, wich is an exercise from the "OpenClassroom" e-learning platform. We first started to approach the Monty Hall Probem using only python list and functions. The objective of this exerecise was to understand the potential and efficiency of Numpy over simple Pyhon lists.
