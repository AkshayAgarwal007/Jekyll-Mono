We are part of the
[Department of Physics & Astronomy](http://www.physics.uwo.ca) at [Western University](http://www.uwo.ca).
We study the contents and properties nearby galaxies, trying to
figure out the relationships between the stars, gas, dust, and star
clusters they contain, and how they make new stars.
Using observations from telescopes on Earth and in space, we map out star-forming regions, carbonaceous molecules, and X-ray-emitting binary stars.

We use innovative computational and statistical techniques to put together the big picture of how galaxies formed.
