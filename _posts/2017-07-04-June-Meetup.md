title: June 2017 Android Meetup Summary
---

Hello Florida summer! Hope all you Android devs are keeping cool and staying dry.  With all of the exciting anouncements from Google IO last month, we can't wait to dig into some new talks.

## June 2017 Android Meetup Summary
----

### Topic 1: [Kotlin, Kotlin, Kotlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzpquJ85pEU)
We're all thinking and talking about it, and some of us are even convincing our team leads to start using it. But why Kotlin? What kind of benefits does the language really offer? This will be a brief overview of some of the more simple but highly usable grammatic and syntactic changes that come with Kotlin - type nullability, lambdas, extensions, and beyond - that you can easily sink your teeth into to get going. We'll step through some very basic side-by-side examples of Java - vs - Kotlin (from at least one developer's perspective) to get a taste of the language, and how to start your own process of translating between the two.

### Speaker: Ivan Lugo

Ivan is an all-of-the-time compiled mobile dev. He's always looking for good ideas, great tools, and a better way to build a mouse trap. Moving from a junior to a senior position within his company, Ivan had a serious need to write better code for a fast growing product. So, now he's giving (amateur) talks about things he likes to pretend he knows about, and spreading the good word of Android development!

### Topic 2: [An Introduction to RxJava](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn_wYwUkLks)
RxJava gives us a better way of writing understandable asynchronous code in our Android apps. In this session, we’ll introduce RxJava, and by looking at some examples of solving problems with and without RxJava, we’ll see why it’s a fundamentally better approach to crafting understandable asynchronous code. 

### Speaker: Matt Dupree

K. Matt is a wannabe philosophy professor turned wannabe tech entrepreneur. He works as a mobile engineer at UniKey Technologies, and he's a bit of an automated testing fanatic. He writes about testing android apps often at philosophicalhacker.com, and many of his articles have been featured in Android Weekly. He also has a published O'Reilly mini ebook on "RxJava for Android App Development." He's speaks often at local meetups and recently spoke about Android testing at FloridaDevFest.
