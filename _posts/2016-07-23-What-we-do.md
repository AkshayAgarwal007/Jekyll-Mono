title: What we do
---


Our research group in the
[Department of Physics & Astronomy](http://www.physics.uwo.ca) at
[Western University](http://www.uwo.ca) studies nearby galaxies: the stars, gas, dust, and star clusters they contain, how they make new stars, and the relationship between these. We use observations from telescopes on Earth and in space to map out star-forming regions, carbonaceous molecules, and X-ray-emitting binary stars, among others.


We use innovative computational and statistical techniques to put together the big picture of how galaxies formed.
