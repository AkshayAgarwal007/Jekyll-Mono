About a month ago, I saw and retweeted this thread ([ThreadReader](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/965451839066980358.html) link to the full thread) about femininity in the workplace.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Interesting thread.<br><br>Manages to express in words something I‚Äôve been struggling to understand about myself recently, w.r.t.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why yes the largest section in the tech business article I&#39;m writing right now is Fashion Tips</p>&mdash; Stephanie Hurlburt üîú GDC (@sehurlburt) <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/965451839066980358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">19 February 2018</a></blockquote>


And it got me thinking about how, for the most part, I still present to the world about the same as I did before I transitioned.
i.e. jeans, nerdy tshirt, usually a hoodie, and no make-up at all. My hair is much longer than it used to be, and I have rather obvious boobs now, but for the most part... yeah. Not much has changed.

I tell myself that this is just my aesthetic, and not to worry about it. And because I also consider myself to be non-binary[^1], I kinda just lumped it in with that.

[^1]: I've not figured out what my gender actually more specifically than "not-male"

But then, a couple of weeks ago, I was in London with a friend of mine, and we happened across [a Belgian shop](https://www.hemashop.com/gb) which, among many other things, had a large selection of nail polish. It reminded me that I've wanted to paint my nails basically forever, but never really got around to doing it. So I bought some. Specifically, I bought some in what was the closest approximation I could find to [LucyPurple](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%23cc0066)

But then... they just sat in the bag, unopened.

I told myself that I just hadn't got around to it yet, or that I didn't have time, or that I needed extra tools [^2]. But these were just excuses I told myself.

[^2]: e.g. an emery board, Q-Tips, and nail varnish remover, which I went out and bought to remove this excuse

This was looking like it was going to be a repeat of an idea I came up with after [FOSDEM](https://engineering.skybettingandgaming.com/2018/02/12/fosdem-2018/). In that case, every day of the long-weekend, I was almost exclusively in the company of awesome queer folk. So I let myself wear ever so slightly more feminine clothing (including an awesome trans-gopher shirt on the Saturday).

After I got back home[^3], I came up with the idea of a "Femme Friday", whereby I'd let myself wear some of my more feminine clothes to work.
The furthest that ever went was wearing a long plaid shirt on top of what I normally wore to work.

[^3]: Technically, I came up with the idea as a kind of new-year's resolution thing at the start of January, but I don't think I actually did it until I got back from FOSDEM.

And then, a few days ago I saw and retweeted this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cis women, if you ever see a trans woman in her 30s, 40s etc. wearing something that looks too juvenile for her, leave her alone about it.

And I think that's when it clicked in my head what was actually going on here, and it's something which should not have been a surprise to me:

# I'm self-conscious.

![They call me Captain Obvious, for saying obvious things](/images/posts/2018-03-15/captain-obvious.jpg)

As much as I like to tell myself that I don't care what other people think of me, it occurred to me that I'm still scared to do much in public that's actively feminine.

On the far extreme of this, I have several skirts, which I desperately want to wear outside, or to work, but I'm too scared to actually leave the house in.

But that's silly!

I've been self-conscious about a great many things before, and I've got over it!

I used to be terrified of using female toilets in public, but now it's no big deal.

I used to be terrified of talking to my team's client at my previous job, but that became no big deal fairly quick.

I used to be terrified of public speaking (I still am, to an extent), and then I did a talk in front of about 200 people at FOSDEM, and it went okay, so now I'm considering doing more of that kind of thing.

My point is... I do a thing which scares me, and then it's fine.

So perhaps I should do more things that scare me?



So, long story short, I painted my nails last night.

It wasn't perfect (I wasn't expecting it to be), but it looks okay. And importantly, I've come in to work and it's no big deal.

I found myself hiding my nails on the tram in to work this morning (initially), and hiding them at work (initially). But now... it's no big deal.

So I should just do more stuff like this which scares me.

It'll be fine, and I'll feel much better for doing it[^4].

[^4]: And I've done a blog post about it now, so I have to do it, right? üòâ
