Day3: My first day "SCRUMming" around. 

## SCRUM & Sprint-Meating
----
The Wednesday was dedicated to Crates model of work, [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org).
Every to weeks on Wednesday the whole team meets up and discusses a new workcycle (called sprint) and divides the work (called stories) among the different developer teams.

I started my day by researching a bit about SCRUM and it’s philosophy because I wanted to be prepared for the up coming  hours.
