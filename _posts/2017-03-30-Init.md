Hello again world.

Well, after about 6 years[^1] I'm back to... what is this exactly? Blogging? Journaling? Rambling? No idea. I'm not even 100% what I'm going to put on here.

So, if I don't even know yet what this is for, what am I doing starting it?

Firstly, I've had some major surgery last week[^2], so I'm off work recovering for the best part of two months, which means I'm gonna be bored out of my mind!
This... whatever this becomes... gives me something to do besides binge watching YouTube and Netflix[^3].

But also, I've got a bunch of projects up in the air, some of which I'm actively working on, some more casually, and some which haven't had the dust blown off them in years.

While I have started tracking tasks related to these in JIRA[^4], this will give me somewhere to write about stuff I've done and how I solved certain problems.

So even though there's no guarantee what I'm gonna post here, or how often, or even if it'll stick around for more than one or two posts, watch this space!



[^1]: More or less. It's been a while since my last blog/journal/thing was online, let alone maintained. [^5]
[^2]: I'm probably not going to go into details here
[^3]: Don't be fooled, I'm still totally gonna binge watch lots of YouTube and Netflix
[^4]: Because of course I have my own JIRA
[^5]: And yes, footnotes. Because footnotes.
