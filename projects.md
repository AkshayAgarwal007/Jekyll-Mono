### [Anagrams solution](https://github.com/) 
This is a set of Python scripts designed to resolve the backend challenge called "Follow the white rabbit" by the TrustPilot development team. The script finds the first level solution in less than twenty minutes.

### [HealthAdvisor App](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxNNG2RMDZe8WUVvTnpRSUFweEk)
This is an application developed from an interface prototype developed for the Human Machine Interaction exam. The application allows you to create reminders for taking medications or for various types of measurements. Through the user's feedback, the application is able to process monthly and weekly statistics about the measurements that are being made, and also allows you to submit charts to the doctor associated with the cure you are following. Finally, the application allows, through gps, to locate the pharmacies present in the surrounding area.

### [NoSQL Multimedia Database](https://github.com/christian161291/mongodatabaseGit) 

It's a NoSQL database powered by MongoDB and provided with a Java interface. It's allowed to insert pictures, documents, videos, audio files and any kind of multimedial data. There is an authentication login and a support for the GridFS storage engine.

### Malware Analysis 

It's a project that concerns basic analyses of various malwares. Malware analysis is a very complex and hard task and consists of a static and dynamic analysis to be able to observe and understand the behavior of malicious software from every point of view. The project explores a malware for desktop systems and two malware for mobile systems, emphasizing the importance of the approach to the study of this activity and the results achieved.

### [Iris Segmentation](https://github.com/christian161291/irisSegmentation) 

This projects oncerns one of the crucial phases of Iris Recognition: segmentation. Among the various steps of iris recognition (acquisition, segmentation, standardization, coding and comparison), segmentation is the fundamental one because it takes care of separating the pupil from the iris and the iris from the sclera to get boundaries. The project was carried out using the MATLAB software and led to the creation of two different solutions: 1 - Segmentation by Daugman method (circular integro differential operator); 2 - Segmentation by the Hough transformation,  the Viola-Jones algorithm and a matrix of similarity.
