### [Anagrams solution](https://github.com/) 
This is a set of Python scripts designed to resolve the backend challenge called "Follow the white rabbit" by the TrustPilot development team. The script finds the first level solution in less than fifteen minutes.

### [HealthAdvisor App](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxNNG2RMDZe8WUVvTnpRSUFweEk)
This is an application developed from an interface prototype developed for the Human Machine Interaction exam. The application allows you to create reminders for taking medications or for various types of measurements. Through the user's feedback, the application is able to process monthly and weekly statistics about the measurements that are being made, and also allows you to submit charts to the doctor associated with the cure you are following. Finally, the application allows, through gps, to locate the pharmacies present in the surrounding area.

## Academic Projects

### [Network Anomaly Detection]()
Cybersecurity project at the University of Salerno, concerning an anomaly detection activity on network traffic (using .pcap files processed by Wireshark). The language used is Python and the variables chosen for classification are throughput and RTT (Round Trip Time). The project involves machine learning techniques, in particular supervised machine learning and uses the cross validation and the Gaussian distribution to refine the values ​​of the thresholds to distinguish the usual traffic from the potentially anomalous one.

### [JPEG Scrambling]()
Data Compression project at the University of Salerno to perform a scrambling of the faces (detected by the Viola-Jones algorithm) of images in JPEG format through a replacement of the DCT coefficients, in order to hide the identity of the subjects involved.

### [QGIS Project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TK_HR-RcLyy5yW3KRhdfF0i23r2Fsfde)
Geographical Information Systems project at the University of Salerno, concerning an Android application that allows users to view areas with water risk and to report any anomalies. The data were processed using the QGIS software and the synchronization was implemented through the WMS service and cloud support provided by the QGIS Cloud plugin.

### [CSTP App](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxNNG2RMDZe8X0RYNjNmNFpJZUE)
It is an application for Android and intended for the CSTP transport service in Salerno. Using the application you can: view the coach times, view the current position of a coach by gps update, create custom paths to monitor, view nearby stops and store tickets or subscriptions. 

### [NoSQL Multimedia Database](https://github.com/christian161291/mongodatabaseGit) 
It's a NoSQL database powered by MongoDB and provided with a Java interface. It's allowed to insert pictures, documents, videos, audio files and any kind of multimedial data. There is an authentication login and a support for the GridFS storage engine.

### Malware Analysis 
It's a project that concerns basic analyses of various malwares. Malware analysis is a very complex and hard task and consists of a static and dynamic analysis to be able to observe and understand the behavior of malicious software from every point of view. The project explores a malware for desktop systems and two malware for mobile systems, emphasizing the importance of the approach to the study of this activity and the results achieved.

### [Iris Segmentation](https://github.com/christian161291/irisSegmentation) 
This projects concerns one of the crucial phases of Iris Recognition: segmentation. Among the various steps of iris recognition (acquisition, segmentation, standardization, coding and comparison), segmentation is the fundamental one because it takes care of separating the pupil from the iris and the iris from the sclera to get boundaries. The project was carried out using the MATLAB software and led to the creation of two different solutions: 1 - Segmentation by Daugman method (circular integro differential operator); 2 - Segmentation by the Hough transformation,  the Viola-Jones algorithm and a matrix of similarity.

## Presentations

### [Bachelor's thesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oPsx7CJ4r9y-dYWhEQXbxLARhFbwhs8_JhGW6lBVnkM) 
The topic mainly concerns the differences in terms of performance between the native implementation of IPsec (kernel level) in IPv6 and the traditional implementation at application level implemented through tunneling. The thesis is divided into three chapters: the first chapter deals with IPv6, IPv4 and IPsec protocols; in particular the focus is on the relationships between the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols and the IPsec protocol. The second chapter shows the implementation details of the two configurations and the tools used. Finally, in the last chapter, the results obtained during the testing phase are presented and commented on.

### [Lamport's scheme](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxNNG2RMDZe8RkNlUzJ3dlUwaVk) 
This is my presentation about the Lamport's scheme and its security. The presentation provides a formal description and a formal proof.
