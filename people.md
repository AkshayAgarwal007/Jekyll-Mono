## Pauline Barmby (group leader)

My current research focuses on nearby galaxies, particularly the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and
other galaxies in our Local Group. I've used quite a few different telescopes and instruments, with a lot of emphasis on infrared observations with the [Spitzer Space Telescope](http://ssc.caltech.edu). My group has studied star-forming regions, star formation laws, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and X-ray emitting star clusters in M31, among other topics.

I came to Western from the [Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sao), where I was a member of
the Spitzer/IRAC instrument team and worked on a variety of science topics including distant galaxies and variable stars in the Milky Way. My [PhD thesis](http://zenodo.org/record/49389?ln=en) was on globular clusters in the Andromeda galaxy, and I started my research career working on galaxy clusters.

Here are my [CV](https://github.com/PBarmby/cv/blob/master/pbarmby_cv.pdf) and [blog](http://pbarmby.github.io).

## Robin Arnason (PhD student)

I'm interested in the details of the formation and evolution of binary systems that have a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star, and black hole) inside our Galaxy. Studying compact object binaries is difficult in the Milky Way, where there is a lot of uncertainty about the distance, age, and metal content of stellar populations, so we often use globular clusters or nearby galaxies instead. In the past, I've investigated the [unusual properties of a very faint X-ray binary in the globular cluster M15](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07117). Currently, I am conducting a survey of the X-ray binaries in the Sculptor Dwarf spheroidal Galaxy. Like the globular clusters, dwarf galaxies tend to be relatively simple in terms of having one distance, age, and metallicity.
However, they are much better than globular clusters at representing binary evolution in an environment similar to the Milky Way, since they don't have the same high stellar density.

## Alex Kiar (BESc/HBA 2018; USRA 2016)

<img align="right" src="{{ site.url }}/images/alex.jpg">
[Alex](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/alexkiar)'s research involves the use of clustering algorithms to analyze a multi-wavelength astronomical catalog
of point sources in a nearby galaxy. FInd an abstract for his conference presentation on this work [here](http://www.casi.ca/casi/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Abstract-book-draft-6-complete.pdf). He doesn't usually wear a suit.

## Sahar Rahmani (PhD 2016)

[Sahar's](https://sites.google.com/site/rahmanisahar/) research involves using modern statistical and machine learning techniques to study the star formation rate in external galaxies. Find her publications [here](author:"Rahmani, S" AND  author:"Barmby") and her PhD thesis [here](http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/4061/).

## Neven Vulic (PhD 2016, MSc 2012)

[Neven](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/neven.vulic) is interested in the X-ray populations of nearby galaxies (M31, M51, etc.), specifically X-ray binary systems. What are the impact of various environmental parameters on the formation and evolution of X-ray sources? In addition, he studies the characteristics of X-ray populations, such as physical/flux distributions and variability, to investigate their connection with galaxy properties.
He is now a Postdoctoral Associate at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

Find his Western webpage [here](http://astro.uwo.ca/~nvulic/), PhD thesis [here](http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/3802/) and
